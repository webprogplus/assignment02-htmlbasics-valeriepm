        Chartreuse (Yellow-green) <br>
        <br>
        Chartreuse is a color midway between yellow & green that was named due of 
        its resemblance to the green color of one of the French liqueurs called green chartreuse, introduced in 1764.<br/>
        <br>
        Etymology <br>
        <br>
        The French word chartreuse means "charter house". The monasteries that the monks of the Carthusian order 
        (who started producing Chartreuse liqueur in 1764)
         live in, the first one of which was established 
         in 1082 by Saint Bruno, are called charter houses
          because they were chartered—and given generous 
         material support—by the Duke of Burgundy known as 
         Philip the Bold when he took over the area in 1378. Philip the Bold's elaborately 
         decorated tomb was initially installed at a Carthusian charter house when he died in 1404. <br>
